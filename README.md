t-rex website
=============

The [t-rex website](https://t-rex.tileserver.ch/) is created with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator.

When pushing a branch, Travis CI generates the static pages, writes them into the `gh-pages` branch and pushes the repo. This updates the site on Github pages.

The `master` branch follows the `master` branch of [t-rex](https://github.com/t-rex-tileserver/t-rex) and is published on https://t-rex.tileserver.ch/. The `release` branch documents the latest release and is published on https://t-rex.tileserver.ch/dev/.

Some tasks are automated in a [Justfile](https://github.com/casey/just/).

* `just`: Serve site
* `just --list`: List all tasks

git push
```
